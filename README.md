# Austin-the-special-robot
Alright heres how this is gonna be organized. Each modification will have its own program (Just copy and paste
the old program and then modify). Each program **MUST BE NAMED THE ROBOT'S NAME AND WHAT VERSION OF THE PROGRAM 
IT IS** (Example: Austin V1.c, Austin V2.c, etc.). This is to keep everything organized and to have the old programs
if needed. Only major modifications need this (minor changes to keep it working is alright).
